  In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples.
  The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
  (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality 
  between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model
  these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the
  best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),
  etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity
  analysis procedure).
 
4. Relevant Information:

   The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
   For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
   Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables 
   are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.
   The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than
   excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent
   or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So
   it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. 

5. Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. 

6. Number of Attributes: 11 + output attribute
  
   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of
   feature selection.

7. Attribute information:

   For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

   Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)  固定的酸度
   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3) 挥发性酸
   3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)  柠檬酸
   4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)  剩余糖分
   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3 氯化物
   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) 游离二氧化硫
   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)  总二氧化硫
   8 - density (g / cm^3)  密度
   9 - pH
   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)   硫酸盐
   11 - alcohol (% by volume) 酒精
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

8. Missing Attribute Values: None

9. Description of attributes:

##### 1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
#####     固定的酸度:与葡萄酒或固定或不挥发性有关的大多数酸(不容易挥发)
##### 2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste
#####     葡萄酒中醋酸的含量过高会导致不愉快的醋味
##### 3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
#####     少量的柠檬酸可以给葡萄酒添加新鲜感和风味
##### 4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet
#####     剩余糖分:发酵后残留的糖量，很少能发现含有少于1克/升的葡萄酒和大于45克/升的葡萄酒被认为是甜的                    
##### 5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
#####     氯化物:葡萄酒中的盐含量
##### 6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
#####     游离二氧化硫:SO2的自由形式存在于分子SO2(as a溶解气体)和bisulfite离子之间的平衡;它可以防止微生物的生长和葡萄酒的氧化                      
##### 7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
#####     总二氧化硫:S02的自由和束缚形式;在低浓度下，SO2在葡萄酒中是无法检测的，但在自由SO2浓度超过50ppm的情况下，SO2在鼻子和葡萄酒的味道中变得明显                       
##### 8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
#####     密度:水的密度与水的密度接近，这取决于酒精和糖的含量
##### 9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale
#####     描述一种葡萄酒的酸性或碱性从0(非常酸)到14(非常基本);大多数葡萄酒的pH值在3 - 4之间
##### 10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
#####      硫酸盐:一种能促进二氧化硫(S02)水平的葡萄酒添加剂，它是一种抗菌剂和抗氧化剂
##### 11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
#####      酒精:酒的酒精含量百分比
   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)  0（非常差）和10（非常好）之间
